# Lesson 6.2 Notes

## XHR vs. Fetch, Get Requests, & Promises

## Key Terms:

- XHR
- Fetch
- Axios
- Get Requests
- Promises
- Query strings
- Metadata
- Browser
- Inspector

## Essential Questions:

- What are promises?
- How does XMLHTTPRequest(XHR) API differ from the Fetch API?
- What are common APIs that engineers use to make asynchronous AJAX requests?
- When would developers send GET requests and how are they formatted?
- How can higher order functions be utilized to more DRY (don't repeat yourself) AJAX requests?
- How do metadata and query strings impact AJAX requests?
- How can code be written for the edge cases when APIs don't return the expected data?

## Learning Assignments:

**Assignment 1: Reference Documentation**

- [XMLHTTPRequest (XHR)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)
