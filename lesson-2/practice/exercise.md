# Lesson 6.2 Practice

## XHR vs. Fetch, Get Requests, & Promises

**Exercise 1:**
Which portion of this URL is the query string? What is the purpose of the query string in this particular example?
https://itunes.apple.com/search?artist=Janelle%20MonÃ¡e

**Exercise 2:**
Reference the code snippet below. Why would an engineer decide to create the higher order function `sendHttpRequest()`
and then invoke it within `getData()` and `sendData()`?

```javascript
const sendHttpRequest = (method, url, data) => {
	return fetch(url, {
		method: method,
		body: JSON.stringify(data),
		/*Read more about the conditional operator below (condtion ? expressionA : expression B) via MDN documenation*/
		headers: data ? { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } : {}
	}).then(response => {
		if (response.status >= 400) {
			// !response.ok
			return response.json().then(errResData => {
				const error = new Error('Something went wrong!');
				error.data = errResData;
				throw error;
			});
		}
		return response.json();
	});
};

const getData = () => {
	sendHttpRequest('GET', 'https://reqres.in/api/users').then(responseData => {
		console.log(responseData);
	});
};

const sendData = () => {
	sendHttpRequest('POST', 'https://reqres.in/api/register', {
		email: 'eve.holt@reqres.in'
		password: 'pistol'
	})
		.then(responseData => {
			console.log(responseData);
		})
		.catch(err => {
			console.log(err, err.data);
		});
};
```

**Exercise 3:**
Reference the code snippet in Exercise #2. What is the purpose of conditionally rendering the
headers key value within the `fetch()` of `sendHttpRequest()`?

**Exercise 4:**
Reference the Advice Slip API's [Random Advice endpoint](https://api.adviceslip.com/#endpoint-random).
Code a function named `getRandomAdvice()`, which logs a piece of random advice to the browser console.
Make sure you include error handling. Include helpful messages or labels to clearly distinguish your log
statements response object, data object, and piece of advice or other messages. Copy and paste your code to
a browser console. Then, invoke `getRandomAdvice()` in order to check your solution.

**Exercise 5:**
Reference the Advice Slip API's [Advice by id endpoint](https://api.adviceslip.com/#endpoint-id).
Code a function named `getSpecificAdvice()`, which logs a piece of specific advice based on the id `100000`;
to the browser console. Make sure you include error handling. Include helpful messages or labels to clearly
distinguish your log statements response object, data object, and piece of advice or other messages.
Copy and paste your code to a browser console. Then, invoke `getRandomAdvice()`in order to check your solution.

Look at data the helpful console log messages. Compare and contrast the response object and data object
between exercise #4 and this exercise (#5). Briefly explain why the difference exists.

**Exercise 6:**
Refactor your function from exercise 5 and name it `getAdviceById`. This function should:
a. accept an any id as a parameter so that the function is reusable
b. either log a piece of advice to the console OR log that the id is not found.
c. follow all other tips from exercise #5 regarding error handling and helpful console logs.

Copy and paste your code to the browser console. Then, invoke `getAdviceById()` as many times
as you'd like in order to check your solution.

**Exercise 7:**
Visit the [google developers fetch api lab](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/lab-fetch-api).
Complete the set up in section 1. Code out the necessary methods to successfully fetch a resource
in section 2.
